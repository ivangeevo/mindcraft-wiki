The Planet of Yah is In an alternate dimension, from the one we live in, on a planet not too different from "our" Minecraft world...

&#x20;People lived their lives peacefully, with centralized governance providing stability and order. However, the thirst for power and technological advancement gradually corrupted those in charge. They began to experiment with interdimensional portals, hoping to unlock new realms and resources to further their goals.

Their reckless experimentation led to a catastrophic failure. The portal, once a gateway to another "custom" dimension, collapsed in on itself, tearing reality apart in the process. The ensuing implosion consumed everything in its path, from the cities and towns of the world to the very fabric of space and time itself. Those who survived the cataclysm found themselves stranded in a strange and barren landscape, with little hope for survival.







You awaken in this desolate wasteland, unsure of where you are or what has happened. The once-familiar sky is a sickly shade of red, and the air is thick with ash and dust. You see no signs of civilization at first glance. Scouring through the dusty desert for what seems like an eternity, you finally see something in the distance and it looks like a village with people... struggling to eke out a meager existence in this hostile new environment.

As you explore this strange world, you begin to uncover the remnants of the past. Ruined buildings and artifacts hint at a once-great civilization, while strange new creatures and phenomena suggest that the portal experiment had unintended consequences. With limited resources and no clear path forward, you must rely on your wits and survival skills to make your way in this harsh new reality.

Will you band together with other survivors to rebuild what was lost? Will you uncover the secrets of the portal and attempt to repair the damage? Or will you forge your own path, carving out a new existence in this shattered world? The choice is yours, but the challenges are many. Welcome to the Mindcraft modpack - a world of endless possibilities, and infinite danger.
